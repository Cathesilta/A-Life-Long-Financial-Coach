## A-Life-Long-Financial-Plan
This repository assists individuals who are not wealthy in making decisions for their long-term financial goals. It does so by calculating potential future wealth, visualizing this wealth, and comparing probable income.

By far, I've got not much financial education. I've only got some intuitive tastes after reading through "Poor Dad Rich Dad", "Guide To Invest" (Robert Kiyosaki), and attended in the MIT open finance courses (Andrew Lo).

I'll be glat if you have some comprehending suggestions in the Issues sector.
